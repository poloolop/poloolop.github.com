<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://righttoinformation.gov.in/">Right To Information</a> (RTI) Act adds to the seven fundamental and other constitutional rights given by the sovereign state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> to it's citizens. It was enacted in 2005 and has been one of the key achievements of the current UPA government.<br /><br />I recently used RTI to get some information from <a href="http://www.iimidr.ac.in/iimi/pages/institute/right-to-information-act-2005.php">IIM-Indore</a>. The application as well as the reply is available <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dpprgs3_29dr56zffm">here</a>.<br /><br />For enhancing transparency further, public education institutes should also<br /><ol><li>Publish Annual Reports - <span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://www.hbs.edu/about/annualreport/2007/">Example</a></span></li><li>Publish Research and Faculty's profile - <span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/">Ex 1</a>, <a href="http://iimahd.ernet.in/faculty/facultyresearch.htm">Ex 2</a>, <a href="http://isb.edu/Faculty/">Ex 3</a>  </span><br /></li></ol>These basic disclosures make a lot of sense, as they will help reduce the number of  RTI applications. Had IIM-I published regular annual reports, it would have saved me from having to use RTI.<br /><br />They may learn from <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/">PMO</a> which regularly publishes its activities. I have also sent the same suggestion to PMO, Ministry of HRD and few IIMs.<br /><br />--<br />US<br /><br />P.S - IIM-A's online feedback form returns a page not found error <span style="font-size:85%;">(<a href="http://iimahd.ernet.in/thanksfeedback.php?m=yes&amp;">link</a>)</span>.<br /><br /></div>
