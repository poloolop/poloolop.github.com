## Memorable

I turned 31 earlier this year. That is more than eleven thousand days completed and quite a few memories of days gone by. [Housing.com](https://housing.com/) recently launched their new brand identity and asked people to share their stories on optimism. In my previous two posts I covered two such incidents, this post is about another one. 

I have written about [trips](http://umangsaini.in/2013/07/jabalpur/) in the past, and usually trips create memories for a lifetime. This post is on my recent trip to Agra in September.

##Beginning
I have travelled to my home town from Bangalore many times, it should be around my 20th trip in last ~9 years. It was perhaps the shortest, only the weekend. We went by train, the trusty Karnataka Express which takes 40 hours to cover 2400km and 34 stations in between. Thankfully I stop get out at Agra, (1700 km and 36 hours). Its a super long journey and over the years my patience has been on a steady decline. The train took same 40 hours 10 years back and continues to be the same today. It's been darn reliable though. I have used it on most if not all my trips back home. It's the only train that takes me directly to Agra from Bangalore. There are two more trains that go to Delhi via. Agra, however they don't stop there, so are not useful.

##Middle
We usually throw the travel days from our trip memories. They are fillers, time spent in travelling is usually not remembered. There is excitement of going somewhere, but the travel itself is not the key part of the experience to be remembered. This could be reason we usually forget about the days we spent travelling from some place to the other, unless something memorable happens. Sadly that's rare. 

This particular train is different, it parts you from your normal life for entire 36 hours straight. An entire day, stolen away from the usual push-pull of a metropolitan city's life. You have your 6feet by 2feet berth and 7 others (in 3-tier) sharing 1/8th of a coach with you. A typical coach has ~72-74 such berths in nine blocks. One is never sure what kind of fellow travellers one gets, and over the years you get a wide variety. Sometimes the trip becomes memorable because of the fellow travellers one meets. That is also extremely rare though. In my ~20 years of travelling by train, I remember just two such interesting incidents. One happened on Delhi-Agra train where I met an sportsman from Indian Army. His account of his daily struggles and aspirations made the travel part memorable. 

What made this particular travel day memorable was its brevity. I was travelling only for two days to attend a ceremony, and thus the portion of travel time was significantly longer than the trip. There was also the incident on return path, where I was to take train from Agra to Delhi and then flight from Delhi to Bangalore. Sadly the train came an hour too late, and we had to rush by a cab to Delhi. You can only so much rely on Indian railways. Live and learn. But such things are what make the day memorable. 

##Conclusion
Don't ignore the travel part of a trip. Sometimes memories formed during travel are stronger than the ones made at the destination. This is why I look forward to enjoying my travel days as well. There's one coming soon, looking forward to it. If you have had memorable travel days, do share in comments. 

Best, Umang
