On 27th July 2006 with the launch of Conroe (Core 2 Duo for Desktops), I had made a <a href="https://umangsaini.site/2006/08/27th-july-time-to-build/">call for building Desktops</a>. On 27th August it is now the time to build Laptops because Merom (Core 2 Duo for Laptops) has now been released by Intel.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question:</span> What's the key difference between Core Duo and Core 2 Duo in Laptop space?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span><br /><span style="color: red;">Power Profile</span> - Nearly the same. 40% better than Pentium M profile<br /><span style="color: red;">Performance </span>- 9-12% better (I didn't test this, just read from several online reports)<br /><span style="color: red;">Price</span> - for T5500 (2MB Cache) is around $100 more than Core Duo baseline and T7200 (4MB Cache) is roughly $200 more<br /><span style="color: red;">Bottomline</span> - If you are willing to shell out $100-200 more for 8-10% performance increase - then go for Core 2 Duo else the cheaper brother Core Duo is sufficient for productivity applications.<br /><br />Most definitely - any notebook with Pentium M is a total waste because it is 40% slower and eats upto 40% more power (Again - I didn't test them - Intel and other reviewers did)<br /><br />--------------<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What to buy?</span><br /><span style="color: red;">High End</span><br />Core 2 Duo T7200 + 1GB RAM (minimum) + 256MB Graphics Card (NVidia or ATI any) + 60 or 80 GB HDD (7200 rpm is preferred)<br />Price will be around $1050 to $1150 (in USA)<br /><span style="color: red;">Budget End</span><br />Core 2 Duo T5500 Or Core Duo T2400 + 1GB RAM (minimum) + regular components - nothing special<br />Price will be around $800 to 900 (in USA)<br /><br />------------<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where to buy?</span><br />Online Dell purchase is preferred by me. Others may try and drop into showrooms to check HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Sony and Acer's prices. Most of the notebooks will be 35-40% more expensive in India than USA/Europe/Singapore prices. So it is most sane to buy from outside India. The best part about this is "<span style="font-style: italic;">Any person can carry one laptop with him without any customs duty</span>" - what this means is any person returning to India from an international visit and not carrying a notebook with him is making a big mistake. Even if one doesn't want a notebook, he can sell it very easily on e-bay and make a significant profit - despite selling it at lower than Indian market price.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel to make a business plan out of this arbitrage. Designate an associate with ready to ship Dell machines USA airport - giving Rs. 5000 to anyone willing to carry the laptop and deliver it in India to me. I can sell then sell it at significant profit margin.<br /><br />Anyway - hope that this information is all that you would be requiring to know for purchase of a notebook. For any further queries, drop me a mail or put it in the comments!<br /><br />--<br />US
