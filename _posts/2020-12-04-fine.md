Namma Bengaluru has been a leader in India in collecting fines from citizens. The compliance to traffic and other civic laws is fairly poor and the deterrence of fines has not been too successfull. Bangalore won the designation of most congested city in 2019. It is not clear if these fines are

I would recommend scrapping these fines completely, and replace them with 'nudges' which actually move the needle towards compliance. I have few ideas

1. All violations against a particular vehicle should be listed on a website - A type of social network for vehicles. 
2. Some violations should be posted on Social Media, as examples to create deterrence
3. Follow-up on call with the vehicle owners who have multiple violations
4. Impound the vehicle if the follow-ups fail to resolve compliance and auction them

The goal is better compliance. Bengaluru is in the process of formulating a Parking 2.0 policy, and that should bring in some revenue. We want traffic police to be gainfully utilized in reducing congestion and not on collecting traffic fines.
