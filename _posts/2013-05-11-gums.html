This post is a submission entry to Indivine network, specifically to Colgate's <a href="http://bit.ly/K6TIoa">My Health Speak Blog</a><br />Gums, we all have them, apart from persistently the decaying teeth. We all tend to get dental issues at some point or the other. You have to brush them twice, floss occasionally and still end up with cavities, sensitive teeth, and gum issues.<br />My anecdote is about my first cavity filling session when I got Dental 101 on maintaining teeth and gums. I got 5 of them done over two evening sessions, at the end of which the dentist was surprised that no root canal was required. All five cavities were super deep and my gums were in bad shape too. They were not bleeding per say, however they were not rose pink and healthy as expected.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-37C0DZzLwss/Ub0u6d77OUI/AAAAAAAADoI/V4zOTjm_XCI/s1600/IMG_3024.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="208" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-37C0DZzLwss/Ub0u6d77OUI/AAAAAAAADoI/V4zOTjm_XCI/s400/IMG_3024.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>Among the list advises, following should come in handy -<br /><ol><li>Always. And he meant always brush twice a day. No exceptions</li><li>Floss daily. OK twice a week, but I don't really follow this one.</li><li>Use Sensitive paste if your teeth are acting up in that direction</li><li>Eat raw fruits / veggies at the end of a meal, so as to somewhat clean your teeth and get rid of sticky oil based food. Why do you think animals don't have to brush? They don't eat cooked food!</li><li>Never eat sweets, drink milk and sleep without brushing or rinsing mouth thoroughly. That's the best way to get cavities galore.</li></ol>So there you have it. Happy dental hygiene to everyone.<br />--US
