The list for [2016](http://umangsaini.cricket/2015/12/2016/), [2015](http://umangsaini.cricket/2014/12/2015/), [2014](http://umangsaini.cricket/2013/12/2014/), [2013](http://umangsaini.cricket/2012/12/2013/) and [2010](http://umangsaini.cricket/2009/12/resolve/). Now for [2017](http://umangsaini.cricket/2016/12/2017/)

From the last year's list only one item succeeded. 1 out of 6. Both experimental resolutions were outright failures as well. 


Here is completely revised list for 2017. It's much shorter.

1. 7-year minimum lock in
2. Minimal Multitasking
3. Run 5km, Cycle 10km per week
4. Movies only @ Theater. (This is exact opposite of my 2010 resolution.)
5. Write

That's it. Only 5 items for this year. 

Happy New Year.

Best, Umang
