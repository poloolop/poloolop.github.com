Living in Bangalore for over 10 years now, I've had a chance to explore the surroundings quite a bit. New wave of convenient online services make it extremely easy to plan such excursions to minute detail. For example, take  <a href="http://www.yatra.com/flight-schedule/ " target="_blank"> Flight Schedule </a> , it gives convenient packages to tours for many tourist locations at reasonable prices.  <a href="http://www.yatra.com/international-flights/bangalore-to-singapore-flights" target="_blank">Bangalore to Singapore Flights</a>,  <a href="http://www.yatra.com/international-flights/bangalore-to-dubai-flights" target="_blank">Bangalore to Dubai Flights</a>, etc. It's far easier to plan using such websites and stay within one's chose budget and things to do.

In this post I am writing about my trip to Chikmagalur where I booked hotel using online services
