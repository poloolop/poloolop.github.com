<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I opined about my online shopping experience in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-08-31-kindle %}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kindle</a> (where eBay sells cheaper than Amazon) and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-08-24-order %}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Order</a> posts earlier. This post is in submission to 'Future of shopping' <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/topic.php?topic=89" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">contest</a>, run by #eBayCheck whose chrome shopping extension can be found here -&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/eBayCheck_Extention">bit.ly/eBayCheck_Extention</a>.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dVglDBhetCQ/UjO-xPJqHII/AAAAAAAAEHE/gkOthS2ajqk/s1600/Shopping_Cart_by_Iris_Zeible.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Shopping_Cart_by_Iris_Zeible Creative commons" border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dVglDBhetCQ/UjO-xPJqHII/AAAAAAAAEHE/gkOthS2ajqk/s400/Shopping_Cart_by_Iris_Zeible.jpg" title="Shopping_Cart_by_Iris_Zeible Creative commons" width="337" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now what might be in store for shoppers in the year 2030? I am presenting some of the bottlenecks in current model of shopping and hope that in next 16 odd years they will be resolved. Here they are -</span><br /><br /><ol><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Trust</b> - Trust will be the currency on which future of selling will be founded on. It's an incredibly hard thing to build, maintain and grow which also makes it that much more important. I am not prophesying on which methods of trust building will win in the next 15 years, but those mechanisms will lend a new dimension to selling.<br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Delivery Anxiety</b> - I don't know about you but I am typically anxious about the stuff I order. When it will arrive, where it is, who is delivering and will it meet my expectations. Although we have pretty good delivery mechanisms, they are far from being ideal. This point is applicable not only to pure online retailers, but to physical stores who will be taking up home delivery. We need much more sophisticated ways to deliver stuff.<br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mobile Mobile Mobile</b> - It's here already but it hasn't blown the socks of anyone. Mobile will be the only platform of importance for sellers. I know that's a big claim, but its the only computing device you carry everywhere, and consequently its importance in assisting you in making purchasing decisions will only grow. In my book it will eclipse all other platforms in usage and orders, thus shopping experience on mobile will be reinvented multiple times between now and 2030.<br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Moonshot</b> - Finally I present my moonshot - something that will take multiple leaps in technology to deliver.<br /><i>"Self driving Robot Cars delivering Packages to customers"</i><br />For me seeing humans making deliveries in 2030 is a bit too much. I see a fleet of robot vehicles which will replace the current last mile delivery mechanism. Robots are already taking over fulfillment warehouses, and direct delivery to the customer should be the next frontier.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here's hoping some of these will be seen in 2030, and there is much more innovation ahead of us in the world of retail.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Best,</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Umang</span></div>
