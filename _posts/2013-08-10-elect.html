<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Come 2014, ~750+ million strong Indian voters will get a chance to elect new representatives for the sixteenth Lower house of Indian Parliament. 543 seats will go for election sometime around April-May. In the current 15th Indian Parliament, about 30% of these had ongoing criminal cases against them. Interestingly, only 14% of candidates contesting 2009 general elections had criminal cases against them, which indicates that having a criminal case improves ones odds of winning significantly (more than doubles the probability of winning).&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Further sub-dividing the category shows that 14%, or about 75 candidates have serious criminal cases pending against them. According to <a href="http://indianeconomy.columbia.edu/content/lok-sabha-rich-educated-and-criminal" target="_blank">this</a> article in TOI, in these&nbsp;constituencies&nbsp;voters don't really have a choice because majority of candidates contesting there have serious cases pending against them.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Coming to the point of this post, this is not a political blog, but cometh the hour and cometh the topic. This post points two instances in which current administration was involved. It's merely informational for voters to make up their minds.

This was a blatant breach of Constitution, which doesn't allow elected public servants to hold paying posts outside their official duties.<br />The bill was sent back by former President Dr. Abdul Kalam remarking - <i>'to reconsider the propriety of the applying the law with retrospective effect'</i>, among other objections. Here's a quote from this&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-04-22/india/27743198_1_assent-comprehensive-criteria-office-of-profit-bill" target="_blank">TOI April 2008 article</a> -</span><i><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /><br />"Disqualification of SP MP Jaya Bachchan for holding an office of profit opened the floodgates for complaints against over 50 sitting MPs which were onpassed by the President to the Elections Commission as required under Article 103 of the Constitution.Realising the gravity of the situation, the Office of Profit bill was passed by Parliament with retrospective effect ostensibly aimed at nullifying charges of disqualification against the MPs."</span></i></li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FFAv47b0a_k/UgYT5RJJy9I/AAAAAAAAD50/AywSIIMIFH0/s1600/CWG.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FFAv47b0a_k/UgYT5RJJy9I/AAAAAAAAD50/AywSIIMIFH0/s320/CWG.jpg" width="224" /></a></div><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Commonwealth_Games" target="_blank">XIX CWG Delhi 2010</a> - The original estimated budget for the games was $270mn in 2003.
