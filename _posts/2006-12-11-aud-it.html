<div style="text-align: justify;">As 2006 draws to an end, and my pipe-line keeps on increasing, last weekend I wrapped up my biggest work to date - "Aud-it".<br /><br />This work simply consists of an exhaustive logging of every material thing I own. Further, there is the annual income-expenditure report. I planned to have these in order to assess my net-worth and have clarity over my credit position at all times.<br /><br />Sunday morning, I woke up in the worst of conditions and by evening of the same day slept in the best of shapes. A one-day transformation that is worth registering.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);font-size:100%;" ><span style="font-weight: bold;">Morning</span></span><br />My home is in complete mess<br />a. There are spider webs in every conceivable corner<br />b. A thick cover of dust on every item<br />c. My desk is in a complete disarray<br />d. My almirah is full of rubbish and not organized at all.<br />e. I haven't taken bath for Friday and Saturday (cannot explain here why)<br />f. My bed linen needs to be changed urgent ly<br />g. Lots of clothes outside wordrobe<br />h. The bathroom STINKS. It cannot be described in words, how worse it was.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Evening</span><br />a. All spider webs cleaned<br />b. Cleaned all dust<br />c. Organized all almirah's<br />d. Threw off all the rubbish<br />e. Cleaned the desk<br />f. Changed bed linen<br />g. Cleaned the bathroom (took ONE HOUR!) followed by a much needed bath<br />h. Did this Aud-it.<br /><br />Just observe the sea change in my existence. It took mammoth 6 hours to do the above tasks. A transformation that I hadn't taken up for months, delaying it for no worthy reason. I simply wanted to get in good shape before 2007 hits.<br /><br />The audit has brought a slew of numbers into forefront. For example, my net-worth, credit-standing, %likeliness of my possessions ...<br /><br />I am not publishing the Aud-it here, for privacy reasons. But, each one of you reading this, should undertake an aud-it once in a while. It's good to have a snapshot of one's existence. It churns out some good things and gives one deeper insights of one really is.<br /><br />P.S. - I will be releasing a copy of my Aud-it only to friends and family members on their individual request through e-mail. Just in case, if you want to know what lies in there?<br /><br />--<br />US</div>
