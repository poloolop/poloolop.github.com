<div style="text-align: justify;">Lately I have been trying to figure out why I had to drop several items from my <a href="https://umangsaini.mom/2006/12/pipe-line/">to-do list</a>.<br /><br />I am still without a Passport, no Internet connection at home, didn't complete about 10 blog posts, my learning curve is flattening etc.<br /><br />The single answer for all of these is simple - <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Pro-cras-ti-nation</span>. According to Ze Frank, it's just one of the sad little things that makes us human while we wait till d-.<br /><br />There are several perspectives on this, why we end up delaying critical work items, until a point where one fails miserably. It's a type of force field between us and the tasks we are supposed to do.<br /><br />Procrastination has its own formula also (<span class="subHeader1">Discounted Expectancy Theory <span style="font-size:78%;">2</span>)</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Utility = E x V / ΓD</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Expectancy a person has of succeeding with a given task (E),</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The value of completing the task (V)</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The desirability of the task (Utility)</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Its immediacy or availability (Γ) (Capital Gamma)</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Person's sensitivity to delay (D).</span><br /><br />Eventually it boils down to stern discipline, the following links will help to form a definitive perspective on the subject -<br /><br />1.
