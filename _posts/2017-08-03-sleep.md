## Sleep

An interesting comment made in Netflix's Q1-2017 earnings call was as following -
>"Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You’re really - we’re competing with sleep on the margin." - Reed Hastings [Link](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062901-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=7)

It's akin to declaring war on sleep. Technology is slowly but surely eating away different aspects of our lives. The amount of screen time has increased exponentially and continues to increase unabated. In attention economy there are new monopolies, and there are methods to convert.

A side effect of attention economy is that it spills into the way one spends money as well. Google and Facebook's duopoly controls ~64% of online advertisement market, and they are capturing more than 90% of ad revenue growth.

## Smart

Meanwhile some new research claims that the new millenials, born after mid 1990's are on the verge of a mental health crisis, with ever higher reported rates of depression. ([Source: Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/)). A realignment is required on screen time and our dependence on Smartphones. I wrote about durability of smartphones in previous post ([Six](http://umangsaini.in/2017/07/six/)), and came across another article which discusses the same aspect, taking example of Fairphone ([Source 1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com/technology/down-with-the-upgrade)). 

I have a seven-year lock in thumb rule, which states that whatever I am purchasing, I have to try and use it for next seven years at the very least. This narrows down the items in terms of durability and usability which I can purchase.

## Sync

Value systems are evolving quickly and there are new normals and things that are acceptable as normal.
