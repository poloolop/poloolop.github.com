An interesting comment made in Netflix's Q1-2017 earnings call was as following -
>"Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You’re really - we’re competing with sleep on the margin." - Reed Hastings [Link](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062901-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=7)

It's akin to declaring war on sleep. Technology is slowly but surely eating away different aspects of our lives. The amount of screen time has increased exponentially and continues to increase unabated. In attention economy there are new monopolies, and there are methods to convert.

A side effect of attention economy is that it spills into the way one spends money as well.
