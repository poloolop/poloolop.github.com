<div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It can sometimes be difficult to just tell the truth. I recently saw a new advertisement on Youtube, and it reminded me of one such occasion.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/RvGOTeJsZb8/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/RvGOTeJsZb8&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/RvGOTeJsZb8&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First a little bit of background. Water borne diseases have been a bane of Indian healthcare system, leading to significant volume cost burden on common man. These diseases typically erupt every year during summer and rainy seasons, primarily due to poor quality of drinking water supply and sanitation conditions.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The common ones are Cholera, Diarrhoea, Typhoid etc. Estimates suggest that over 10% of disease burden can be reduced if  availability of fresh and good quality drinking water supply, sanitation, hygiene and water resource management is improved. </span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While privileged few who can afford access to filtered and RO water, the general availability of reliable drinking water remains abysmal. It is common to see drinking water camps being setup in summer months, because heat-wave itself is a potent danger to human life. I have known at least one person who died of heat-wave while working outside in summer months. One needs to be extra cautious and take required precautions against dehydration and heat strokes. And scarcity of water is not limited to humans, in urban-concrete areas, often several birds are unable to find water and sometimes die of thirst. It is a good practice to maintain a large earthen bowl of water on rooftops for birds to quench their thirst. If not throughout the year, but at least during summer months.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNSqePqMrzk/VJ5lRAYW98I/AAAAAAAAE84/HjXSeUubf2k/s1600/3413557826_06bb90b0dd_z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img alt="Street food: Attribution Flickr @mattmangum CC 2.0" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNSqePqMrzk/VJ5lRAYW98I/AAAAAAAAE84/HjXSeUubf2k/s1600/3413557826_06bb90b0dd_z.jpg" height="300" title="Street food: Attribution Flickr @mattmangum CC 2.0" width="400" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Street food: Attribution Flickr @mattmangum CC 2.0</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now back to the story. In my childhood days, I got infected with mild&nbsp;Diarrhea&nbsp;and was bed ridden for&nbsp;about three days. After examination, the doctor came to the conclusion that I must have eaten or drank infected food or water during the rainy season, and thus become infected. I being a child, adamantly denied the charge. I stuck to my version of being a good boy, who doesn't get tempted by street food, and always spends pocket money only on sports equipment.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As my recovery was ongoing, my story got a jolt when another friend in the neighborhood also got infected with&nbsp;Diarrhea. He wasn't planning on keeping our little street food session a secret,&nbsp;and at the first instance of inquiry, he laid out all the details to his parents. Word travels faster than speed of light in a society, and soon enough my parents became aware of my little secret. They however didn't confront me immediately. They took a different approach. Once I recovered, they kept poking me subtly about street food, and what was my outlook towards the same. I was irritated a bit, but didn't realize that they had known about my folly all along.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eventually they took me to the same locality where I had got the infection in the first place, and started asking me if I was feeling hungry or anything. The tube light in me finally came to the realization, and I quickly opened about my lapse of judgement and made full disclosure. It's better late than to be sorry about telling the truth and come out in the open.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hope we all learned something. These days, I enjoy street food responsibly. But you can never be 100% sure. Also, better carry your own bottle of water.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Best, Umang</span></div>
