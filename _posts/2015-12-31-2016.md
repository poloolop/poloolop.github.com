The list for  [2015], [2014], [2013] and [2010]. Now for [2016]

Fifth time is a charm. First a statistic, I made 13 pledges last year, and only one of them were successful firmly. 9 failed outright, and 3 were partial successes. So 5 out of 13 got some traction. This got me thinking about taking the pledges seriously. Here we go once more. Hopefully next year I will have a better success rate.

**Outright Failures from last year, and not attempting again**

1. One book a week 
2. Frugal 
3. Minimize Disposable-Plastic Use 
4. Learn a New Language 
5. No Carrom 
6. Catch up with TED (220 pending, 66-hours behind) 
7. Run, 5km a week 
8. Exercise (minimum 5 times a week) 
9. Public Transport

**Partial Success, and continuing**

1. Minimal milk based beverages, No Soft-Drinks 
2. 60 km per week cycling, annual 3000km  (attempted 80 last year) [stats]
3. Vegan (90%) (attempted 95% last year, declined compliance) 

**Successful and continuing**

4. 7-year lock in

**New and Revised ones**

5. One book a month
6. Yoga + Exercise + Run + Cycle - minimum twice a week

**New and Experimental** - This is a new category. I am not sure I will be able to comply with these, however I still want to make an attempt at the same

8. Disposable Packaging  - I will keep a log of all packaged goods I do end up buying this year. It's an attempt to minimize the amount of stuff I throw in a dustbin, even when if it gets recycled. Essentially the preference to buy stuff without packaging and highly recyclable products.
9. Travel - Make time to travel within India, especially Eastern portions.

Drowning in the flood of Capitalism, I've dropped my attempts at being Frugal.

Best, Umang
