The post is about - TRESemmé Ramp Ready Hair - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tresemmeindia">YouTube Channel</a><br /><br />I got shampoo and conditioner from TRESemmé about a week back and have been using the same regularly for the same period. Following are my observations -<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Shampoo lathers well with limited quantity applied</li><li>Shampoo is more or less sufficient for daily use. I am not a regular user of conditioner products and only shampoo worked well for me.</li><li>I didn't get any dandruff issues, scratchiness, dryness etc. in using this shampoo. Sometimes shampoos can be harsh but TRESemmé felt in the milder spectrum of hair products I have used</li><li>Conditioner - I did try out their conditioner and was pleasantly surprised. My earlier experience with conditioners was no-difference felt i.e. it didn't improve my hair situation, but that was not the case with this one. Again, a small quantity felt sufficient to cover my hair and it improved the way my hair felt through the day. Hair were softer and looked much better.</li></ol><br />I'd recommend TRESemmé hair products to anyone. The pricing is also reasonable, not the obscene amounts professional products usually charge. Do give it a try and let me know your experience with TRESemmé.
