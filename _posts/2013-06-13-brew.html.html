There are always two sides of the coin, and currently both sides have withdrawn their versions of the truth from the internet.<br /><br />However Internet has a strong memory, and it's hard to erase stuff. And as expected, both versions continue to live on the internet -<br /><ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/147181239/Lemp-Experience">Lemp Experience</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/147411956/Lemp-Press-Release">People for Lemp</a></li></ol><br />As a neutral third-party, both stories appear to be legitimate to me. The restaurant has full rights to recover its money. However the manner in which it approaches the same is what makes a difference. We'd never know the entire truth to pass judgement on this, however <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/www.zomato.com/ncr/lemp-brewpub-and-kitchen-sector-30-gurgaon">Zomato</a> continues to rate the place 1.2. They removed bulk of negative votes, when total was &gt;3k at a time. Currently the number of votes is only 1.2k.<br /><br /><b>Lessons</b> - Be sure you are clear about the price of items you are ordering. If it turns out otherwise, don't complain, but pay.
