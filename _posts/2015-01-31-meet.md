## Meet
I attended 2015 [Asus Indiblogger](https://www.indiblogger.in/bloggermeet.php?id=276) meet held at Mayra Hall in ITC Gardenia this Friday. Asus was presenting their lastest set of products, and Indiblogger organized a nice meeting for Bengaluru bloggers. The meet was organized well, and provided opportunity to have interesting conversations.
The meet started with music, followed by a meet and greet where one had to convince other people to give some of their personal belonging to you. I managed to collect 11 such artifacts myself. Mainly visiting cards, photographs, bills, and even one comb. Here's a pic of the same -

Asus presented about their products after meet and greet. There was a brief and interesting Q&A with Asus after that. We also got a chance to have a hands on with Asus' products at the venue. 

The meet was rounded up with a group task where four teams created a short advertisement for promoting blogging. Our team created a music video. The meet had started at 6pm and went upto 9:10pm after which dinner was served. I was home by 10:30pm

It was the first time I was attending Indiblogger meet, and this one set the bar quite high. I look forward to attend similar events in the future.

Best, Umang
