<div style="text-align: justify;">There's a strong reason why phone calls are charged by the minute. Nearly every important thing can be conveyed within this time. Why is then one spends hours and hours on phone?<br /><br />I go on to the extent of saying that spending more than 1 minute on any single conversation is a ridiculous waste of time, and more than 10 minutes average in a day is totally ridiculous.<br /><br />You might say 10 minutes a day is too less. Most plans give 600 minutes monthly calls free (20 minutes per day), so one has to utilize that at least. I say this is a trap. And those who fall into this pit, I call them - "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Ph-one Junkies</span>" - people who will call for the sake of calling, having nothing better to do, or worst they consider this a part of *socializing*networking*building friendships*.<br /><br /><br />I know several Ph-one junkies. Usual time on phone ranges from 40 minutes to 3 hours regularly. 40 minutes is still much higher than my hard-limit of 10 minutes.<br /><br />I have a Reliance-CDMA prepaid connection. It costed me Rs. 220 for installation and 1 month validity. Thereafter, I have spent Rs. 205 for last 18 months and got a balance of Rs. 50 flat. One minute call costs me Rs. 2.00, which brings my total calls made to (50*18) /(2.00*60) = 7.5 hours. (My Samsung Slim says 7 hours 15 minutes to be exact)<br /><br />However, I receive lots of calls, primarily from home. Total 32 hours 38 minutes.<br /><br />Total Dialed = 7 hours 15 minutes<br />Total Received = 32 hours 38 minutes<br />Total = 39 hours and 53 minutes ~ 40 hours<br />Total Days of usage = 18 months = 540 days<br />Minutes per day = 40*60/540 = <span style="font-weight: bold;">4.44 minutes per day</span>. 0.80 minutes called, 3.6 minutes received.<br />P.S - This includes calls made to check the pre-paid balance.<br /><br />10 minutes per day is still twice my daily average, and I consider myself lenient user of phone (who calls frequently whenever required). Despite this, I see several <span style="font-style: italic;">Ph-one Junkies</span> having routines of minimum 40 minutes daily routine on phone, and I am forced to wonder why so?<br /><br />I think, it is fairly evident, how much I abhor these <span style="font-style: italic;">Ph-one Junkies. </span>This is not to say that I don't sway sometimes, and talk for irrationally long durations of time, but that is once or twice in a month, and that irrational is 10-15 minutes. For <span style="font-style: italic;">Ph-one Junkies </span>minimum starts at 30-40 minutes and irrational is perhaps 10 hours!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Counter-Argument</span>: How else do you expect people at long-distances to keep their relations?<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Counter-Counter-Argument</span>: By making 1 minute calls. Max 5 minutes.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Counter-Argument</span>: I know 1000 people who are *close friends*, I get minimum 100 calls and have to make 100 calls back.<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Counter-Counter-Argument</span>: Make 1 minute calls, and reduce 1000 to 100. Use e-mails for rest.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Counter-Argument</span>: It saves hordes of money as one can talk without paying a visit.<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Counter-Counter-Argument</span>: I would say, this is a talk for talk's sake. Most of it is CRAP (more on this in subsequent post), bitching or trash-talk. Waste. Waste. Waste.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Counter-Argument</span>: It helps me cut my loneliness.<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Counter-Counter-Argument</span>: Calling someone will not cover that either, it will only delay it a bit. One has to find sustainable ways of being busy and happy to counter loneliness.<br /><br />... And the list continues. I will never agree that more than 10 minutes a day is justified (except for business/work related talk). Anything above is simply trash and it stinks too.
