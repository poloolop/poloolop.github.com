A consequential decision in one's life is the selection of a life-partner. Nothing prepares one to make this decision, and mechanisms society has established are not necessarily the best.

It is primarily an information game, and both sides have an interest in hiding the ugly parts. 

In an ideal world, love-marriage should work for everyone, and it is by-far the preferred way to make the decision. However, many of us chicken out of this, and fall-back to the "arranged" method where family or friends bring prospects, and some sort of selection process takes place across several months and sometimes years. For me this process lasted for around eighteen months, where first twelve months were pretty much a waste.

There are several other aspects to this selection process which need a rethink. At the end of the day, the bride and the groom need to align on which of these aspects they can ignore, and where they need to put their foot down. Some aspects like color of the skin, net-worth (assets), joint-family etc. continue to influence the selection process in the sub-continent. I can say this categorically that none of these "societal" factors have any merit whatsoever. In fact, in many cases the exact opposite of is likely a better choice.

This brings us to something called bio-data, it is the information one is discloses to a prospective match. It is shared with trusted parties along with some photographs. It is woefully inadequate to base any decision based on this information.

So how should one may conduct their search?

Sadly there is no good answer. If we look at the data, majority of couples these days meet online. So internet apparently is the place where you are likely to find some answer. I have few suggestions which may or may not help. I cannot vouch whether any of these will yield any benefit, so take them with a pinch of salt.

1. Parents are a strong indicator of how a person will age. We may not like the genetic-determinism aspect of this, however it is a great indicator. So the wisdom that you marry the family, is largely true. (However siblings are not a great indicator)
2. [Equality](https://umangsaini.site/2021/09/marriage/) matters. The principle of equality is important. Choose a partner who is your equal, as an asymetrical marriage in unlikely to work.
3. You can trust the judgement of your parents, so if they veto someone, it is unwise to go against it, unless you can well and truly convince them otherwise. Going against the judgement of parents is rarest of rare situations, although Bollywood would like to portray it differently.
4. A nominal period of time and counselling is required before agreeing to a match. This should not take too long though, else the indecisiveness may put a strain on the relationship before it commences.

That's all. Four simple points. None of these may be relevant for your search, and at the end of the day we adapt to our choices. So even when the choice may appear to be an impossible one to make, the stars both literally and metaphorically align to make it work.


Best, Umang
