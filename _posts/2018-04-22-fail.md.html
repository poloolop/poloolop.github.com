About four and a half years ago, in September 2013, I decided to convert from a Vegetarian to Vegan. The change may seem gradual, but it is not. It is certainly less drastic than someone going straight from non-Vegetarian to Vegan. There are several risks in going Vegan, and primary one is about getting sufficient nutrition without any animal products.


In my over 4 year struggle, I discovered several aspects about being a Vegan. I am listing a few here

## Reasons
1. **Health** - Its healthier as it removes a vast array of junk food off the table
2. **Weight Management** - It helped me in reducing weight. (Combined with exercise I lost over 15kgs of weight)
3. **Environment** - Animal products are typically harsher on environment than plant based products

## Observations
1. **Its lonely** - It's difficult and most will never attempt.
2. **It requires support** - Your family, friends and colleagues need to support you. I found mixed levels of support and quite a bit of opposition as well
3. **Exceptions** - You will need to make exceptions, in order to not be a jerk.
4. **Unexpected** - There may be unexpected consequences. I ended up in emergency room for uretric colic. I don't know the root cause for the same, however it may be just due to insufficient fluid intake. Vegan diet is harder on stomach (Counter intuitive fact)

## Fail
In the end it was a grand failure. One learns and moves on. I am no longer a Vegan. I don't intend to try again anytime soon. If any of you are planning on taking the plunge, best of luck, its going to be a long and arduous road ahead.

Best, Umang
