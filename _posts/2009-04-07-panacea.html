<div align="justify"></div><blockquote></blockquote>This post is in response to <a href="http://mentalworkout.blogspot.com/2009/03/prosperous-india.html" target="_blank">Prosperity</a>.<br /><div align="justify">One of my colleagues posted his views on ways to increase India’s prosperity. His suggested action items -</div><ol><li>     <div align="justify">Adopt / Guide a Student</div></li><li>     <div align="justify">Guide to a local business to scale</div></li></ol><div align="justify"><b>My two cents</b> -</div><div align="justify">We don't need to tread through multiple layers of complexity to tackle fundamental issues of poverty, inequality and lack of justice. There’s a much simpler route - <b>Education and more education.</b></div><div align="justify">Some would argue that there is no single magical silver bullet. After all, educated people have a major role in creating major global problems, in the first place. I'd say - they require still more education to clean up the mess, else face the consequences.</div><div align="justify">Let's look at a couple of core issues here -</div><div align="justify"><b>Population explosion</b> - What is the solution? According to Swedish professor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling" target="_blank">Dr. Hans Rosling</a> from <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/" target="_blank">Gapminder Foundation</a>, education is a powerful solution known to work. He makes a compelling argument and presents the data to prove it. <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/videos/what-stops-population-growth/" target="_blank">Link</a>. Must see.</div><div align="justify"><b>Sustainability</b> - Again awareness, a.k.a education about sustainable practices. How many have read Jared Diamond’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_(book)" target="_blank">Collapse</a>: How societies chose to fail or succeed?&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)" target="_blank">Science</a> journal review said&nbsp;</div><div align="justify"></div><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #006600;">“It is probably the most important book you will ever read”.</span></blockquote><div align="justify">I posted my notes <a href="https://umangsaini.site/2008/08/implode/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Must read. How many design companies follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McDonough" target="_blank">William McDonough</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_to_cradle" target="_blank">Cradle-to-Cradle</a>?</div><div align="justify">Education / Learning is a liberating experience. It has transformational ability. Infinite productivity gains and limitless potential for economic progress does not address the root cause. Economic progress is merely an indicator. A great economy may lessen the pain, but it's far cry from being a cure. Jared Diamond presents a much more comprehensive list of 12 problems leading to potential societal collapse. Economic growth is not one of them.</div><div align="justify"><strong>Bottomline</strong> -</div><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #006600;">"Education, more education, education made perfect is the only panacea for all our country's ills and evils"</span><br /><div align="right" style="text-align: right;">-Revered Sir Anand Sarup Kt., August Founder of Dayalbagh, Convocation Address, Agra University, 1935</div></blockquote>The above text forms the core mission of my alma-mater. <a href="http://www.dei.ac.in/dei/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=125:a-novel-approach-to-education&amp;catid=33:dei-education-policy&amp;Itemid=291" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a>.<br /><br />--<br />US
