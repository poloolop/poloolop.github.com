>“An investment is by all right-minded people to be commended, because it brings comforts and necessities to the citizenry. But, if continued indefinitely, it will lead to the endless pursuit of unnecessary things.” -- Adam Smith

Economist published a warning in 2015. It read "[Warning: too much finance is bad for the economy](https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2015/02/finance-sector-and-growth)"
