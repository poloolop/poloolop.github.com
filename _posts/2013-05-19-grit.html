She left her job in Management Consulting to go teach Seventh Grade Maths class. She then went on to become a psychologist.<br /><br />Her conclusion after years of observation and methodical studies conducted? She asked -&nbsp; 'Who is successful here and why?'. Her answer. Four letters<br /><blockquote>GRIT = "Passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in day out, not just for a month but for years. Grit is living life like it is a marathon, not a sprint." - Angela Lee Duckworth</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9wZe-tR4Hhg/UbxmOL8HZxI/AAAAAAAADm8/YiGvRyfSxxk/s1600/IMG_2194.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9wZe-tR4Hhg/UbxmOL8HZxI/AAAAAAAADm8/YiGvRyfSxxk/s400/IMG_2194.JPG" width="338" /></a></div><br /><br />Online dictionaries define Grit as 'Indomitable spirit' or 'resolve to do something difficult or unpleasant'.<br /><br />Her closing words - "We need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier"<br /><br />--<br />US
