Huawei has crossed Apple in volume of devices sold per quarter. Here is what the flagship product launch calender looks like

 1. Jan - None
 2. Feb - Samsung Galaxy S series
 3. March - Huawei P Series
 4. April - None
 5. May - OnePlus (budget)
 6. June - None
 7. July - None
 8. August - Samsung Note Series
 9. September - Apple iPhone
 10. October - Google Pixel
 11. November - OnePlus (budget) refreshed T version
 12. December - None
 
I am not aware of what calendar HTC, Sony and Motorola (Lenovo) follow for their flagships, however they are not part of top-5 vendors. I excluded the other top-5 OEMs Xiaomi and Oppo, but kept India relevant budget vendor OnePlus.

The two remaining flagships remaining for 2018 are iPhone XI and Pixel 3XL
