<div style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday reaffirmed the thing I hate the most. Have you ever thought, what is it that you hate the most?<br /><br />I will list a few of them here<br />1. Lack of Hygine ...  Common Sense ... Courtesy ... Discretion<br />2. Trash-talk<br />3. Apathy<br />4. Failure<br />5. ... ...<br /><br />Different people hate different things to different degrees, but when you sit down and evaluate, what is that you hate the most, it is a tough nut to crack. I will point out mine, you can comment back with yours.<br /><br />For me failure is one of my strong hatred areas, BUT within that category, being second is what I hate the most. And same thing happening twice is undoubtedly the biggest agony one may come across.<br /><br />Those who have been in the position will have a better idea, of what I am talking about. You fail, no problem, you will hate it a little. You come third infinite times, no problems again. But when you are second and two times in a row. That is definitively bitter-most spot. (I haven't experienced being second more than 2 times, and I don't want to imagine that situation ever.)<br /><br />Think about your hate points and what you hate the most and comment back.<br /><br />P.S - I have intentionally not mentioned which IInd I am talking about, but people close to me should know easily. And stop telling me it doesn't matter and being second is good enough. <span style="font-style: italic;">Either you play to win or don't play at all</span>. And when you play being second is the worst of all.<br /><br />--<br />US<br /><br />BTW: Boy, I think you would have guessed it by now. If not, then think a little harder, you will get it instantly.<br /><br /><br /></div>
