Water itself is not wet, but makes other things wet as it clings to their surface. This is due to weak bonding between water molecules. It can be attributed to low viscosity and high latent heat of vaporization. Eventually, wetness is a sensation defined specifically about how a thing feels when in contact with a liquid.

Snow forms instead of rain when temperatures are below freezing (zero degrees Celsius). They fall due to gravitational force.

The big clouds get a negative charge and the small ones get a positive charge. Eventually the potential difference is large enough to overcome the dielectric strength between earth and clouds, leading to the discharge.
