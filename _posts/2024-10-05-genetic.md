A consequential decision in one's life is the selection of a life-partner. Nothing prepares one to make this decision, and mechanisms society has established are sub-optimal as well.

It is primarily an information game, and both sides have an interest in hiding the ugly parts. 

In an ideal world, love-marriage should work for all, and it is by-far the most preferred way to take the decision. However, many of us chicken out of this, and fall-back to the "arranged" method where family or friends bring prospects, and some sort of selection process takes place across several months and sometimes years. For me this process lasted around eighteen months, where first twelve months were pretty much a waste.

- rich
- color
- joint-family

This brings us to something called bio-data, it is the information one is willingly disclosing to a prospective match.
