<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The time to chose is here. I am living in South Bengaluru for 7 years now from 2005, and it's the first General Elections where I will vote in Bengaluru. I had failed to summon up my enthusiasm to go out and vote in 2009. Ananth Kumar had retained South Bengaluru in 2009 (fifth straight win), and UPA came back to power.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It looks like this time the opposite may happen. I have followed Nandan Nilekani's career in Infosys and later in public life, and have no doubts on his impeccable credentials and talent. It's time for NDA to come to power, however there's good probability of Congress candidate Nilekani winning from South Bangalore.</span></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="480" scrolling="no" src="//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/461662285?et=qhwKMxKAtUuGrS8k0oAEpA&amp;sig=EKMqehaApH8z39TOyObzsmJ8HklwzPdia18rupMvL9Q=" width="594"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He is by far the 'only' billionaire contesting general elections in 2014.He is 50th on the list of 65 Indian&nbsp;billionaires&nbsp;with Forbes estimated wealth of <b>$1.3bn</b> (INR 7900cr). The man clearly&nbsp;doesn't</span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;need to prove anything, or for that matter contest&nbsp;elections. However, he is contesting and spending his own money on the campaign, which I estimate will be near Rs. 70 lacs, the upper limit allowed by Election&nbsp;commission of India.</span></div></div><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Criticism</b></span><br /><ol><li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Independent </b>- It's an open secret that independent candidates don't win elections. Less than 5 won in 2009, and that number is expected to be below 10 this time as well.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Congress </b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- He has joined an incumbent party which has been in power in central government for 50+ years after independence, and hasn't been able to change status-quo in India (precisely because it represents the status-quo). He may have joined the Anarchy Aadmi Party (AAP), however that would've meant betraying his connections with UPA-II&nbsp;government.&nbsp;He kept his loyalty, however can never justify the&nbsp;monstrosity&nbsp;of a failure which UPA-II&nbsp;government&nbsp;has been.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Adhaar </b>- Central government has budgeted Rs. 10,000cr+ for distributing these ID's however it's immediate benefit / impact hasn't been much to write about. Some estimates suggest that money spent is as high at 37 to 50,000 cr. We definitely need more transparency on how much money has been spent, and is in budget for issuing further ID's. As it's a biometric ID, it help reduce KYC costs which alone should recover it's issuing costs. My suggestion for Adhaar is to make allow citizens to pay and get Adhaar, just like a Passport is issued. We may get a better user experience, as I didn't have a particularly good experience in getting my ID.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ashok Soota, the veteran IT-professional, recently endorsed Nandan openly, and despite above mentioned criticism's, he is in-fact a credible candidate who is capable to bring sustainable development to South Bangalore. Excerpts from Ashok's email, as published by <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Vote-Nandan-Says-Top-IT-Boss-in-Group-Mail/2014/03/28/article2135454.ece#.UzknT6jaK-0" target="_blank">Indian Express article</a> are below</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="background-color: white; color: #5c5c5c; line-height: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">‘Something Wonderful’</span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #5c5c5c; line-height: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">“This mail is to share with you my excitement that something wonderful is happening in Bangalore South.

I also took one T-shirt from the organizers.</span>
