The other motive was - I love to contradict and disprove stuff. All of that was based on one key premise - nothing is absolute. Once you take this - factually every fact can be turned on its head and be proved as relative.<br /><br />All this was fine, till I read "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand, which led me to read her other famous novel - "Atlas Shrugged". The protagonist makes a 56 page climax speech where he lays down his philosophy and understanding of the world. The key statement from that broke my long established quote into pieces.<br /><br />This one statement simply nullifies the above quoted statement as it is Absolute Truth.<br /><br />--<br />US<br /><br />Update (04/24/2007) - The new title of the blog is the answer<br /></div></div>
