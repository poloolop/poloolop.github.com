[HMD Global](https://www.hmdglobal.com/) from Finland is in India, under the name of erstwhile brand 'NOKIA'. They are setting up their repair centers, and rolling out brand new products. In an already crowded market of smartphone vendor's, we get a new one, under an old name though. What is HMD bringing to the table?
</p>
Their launch page on [Amazon.in](http://www.amazon.in/b?node=13773810031&pf_rd_p=aa5b2fce-5637-483a-a8f7-b337db743b42&pf_rd_r=WY81ET3WGRDT8R0V9SZ8) cites following statement
"Designed for perfection. Built to last. Striking clean look. Smooth metal exterior. Available in three colors. Made to be life-proof"

These are lofty ideals, spitted out by marketing to gain our attention and influence our purchase decision. 

I have only one question for HMD Global, how long is "Built to last" supposed to last. You are giving only one-year limited warranty for manufacturing defects. If the thing is truly designed for perfection and built to last, why not offer a three year standard warranty with the product (even at a modest price).

The truth is that the phone is designed to last only one to two years. Its smooth metal exterior and Gorilla glass will show heavy wear and tear if they are not used with a case and screen protector. The parts are typically prohibitively expensive to repair / replace if one wants to continue using the product beyond 2 years.

Built to last is a good marketing slogan. Similar tag lines also used by Lenovo (Motorola) etc. Unless they add meaningful supporting evidence for the same, its all talk. Example get [C2C certification](http://www.c2ccertified.org/get-certified/product-certification). Its the same old consumer product in a new package.

Best, Umang

p.s. One funny thing is that they just announced their partnership with Carl-Zeiss for camera lens'. In one announcement they rendered their current products obsolete (as they are shipping without Zeiss). So much for perfection. So far released Nokia 3, 5, 6. Rumored 7, 8, 9 and 2. Wonder whay they skipped Nokia 1 and 4.
