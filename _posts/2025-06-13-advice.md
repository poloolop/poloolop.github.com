[Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) published advice which he wished he had known earlier on his 68th Birthday. Later he made it into a book - “Excellent Advice for Living: Wisdom I Wish I'd Known Earlier” (Amazon [Link](https://amzn.to/43bFzai)). In this book he gave 460 pieces of advice, and later published 101 more in April 2024. This [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVxQEZz46N5Rs_WUGuACxaZ5P21WkvUor3LZPi5SqExv3ZNh7OfaASEO9C0Px2jQU-IEboyIqLO-tm/pub) has the one’s he publicly posted to his blog (Total 371 out of 561)

I have picked my favorites in the short (214), shorter (38) and shortest (10) lists. If you like them, the book would has ~190 more, so consider buying the book. Enjoy my personal top-10 below. 

- About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.
- Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
- “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.
- Many fail to finish, but many more fail to start. The hardest work in any work is to start. You can’t finish until you start, so get good at starting
- Don’t ever work for someone you don’t want to become.
- You don’t marry a person, you marry a family.
- Always say less than necessary.
- Don’t keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.
- Friends are better than money. The very best way to win a friend is to be one.
- Take the stairs.

Best, Umang
