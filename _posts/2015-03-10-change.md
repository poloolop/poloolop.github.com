## Change

I've written about change a few times in the past, this post is about big-decisions which change the course of your life.

For me buying an apartment was such a big life-changing decision and the process was full of surprises, anxiety and feeling of being completely lost. I was never convinced if it was the right thing or the ideal thing to do, however I took a dive into property market and so far the tale is satisfactory.

[Housing.com](https://housing.com/), which just launched it's new brand, is asking users to share their anecdotes about life changing milestones. For me it was the process of buying my first apartment in 2013.

##Beginning
The most important part was to arrive at the decision to purchase an apartment. I had long discussions and debates with friends and family, and it was conclusive that given the right deal, buying a property made sense, both in terms of financial prudence and medium term peace of mind. In hindsight, this decision was still probably the easiest part of the process.

##Middle
The process itself can be debilitating. The crux of the problem lies in making a budget, identifying suitable properties and then arriving at one you want to invest in. The number of parameters can go out of control and not everyone of them can be satisfied. I know of people who took almost three plus years to complete purchase of a property. Thankfully I was able to complete the process in ~6 months. The search phase took three months and the buying process itself took another three months.

Identifying the property was tedious. One has to pour through multiple websites, talk to lots of agents, owners, builders etc. Then do research about the locality, pricing and follow property trends for that area. One also comes across horror stories of people being duped of their hard earned money by crooks, I was to err on the side of caution, not going with any small builder. The requirement was set for large apartment complexes, preferably low rise, and not high rises. Initially I scoured for new properties however, finally due to budget constraints and locality, I chose a second hand property rather than a brand new development. 

Once the property was identified, the loan process and lawyer to do due diligence were the next steps. Thankfully the owner already knew a lawyer who helped complete property transactions. After getting his nod (recommendation) I approached State Bank of India, however the amount of time taken by them was simply not acceptable. This took me to Punjab National Bank for home loan, and the loan was processed within a week. With SBI I wasted close to a month without any outcome. Once loan was sanctioned, property registration is straight forward process. I did face difficulty in getting BBMP Khata transfer done, and it took ~12 months to get that through bureaucratic procedures. In the end everything went smoothly. It did take a significant portion of time and diligence to close the transaction, get the house ready and shift. I am now a happy home owner.

##Conclusion
There are few things in life which forever change one's life. Big decisions are always difficult and sharing the experience helps others to take the leap and march ahead. Life is full of exciting possibilities and I look forward to more such life-changing positive outcomes.

Best, Umang
