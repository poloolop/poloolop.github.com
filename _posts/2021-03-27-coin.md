Well 2021 is not very different from 2020. The world changed suddenly and we are yet to pick up the pieces. Although I did not post for much of 2020, it was not due to overwork or fatigue. I did, however realized that it is hard for me to turn off, and there is always the temptation to keep at it. 

As one grows old, one tends to accumulate regrets. They are generally linked to missed opportunities, about the doors which closed while we were day dreaming. One common example would be the people who did not buy Bitcoin. There are ~18.6mn coins in circulation and only 21mn will ever exist for a population closing in on the 8bn mark. 

It will be one of my regrets to not attempt to buy Bitcoin and forgetting details of a wallet holding 0.02 BTC worth INR 86k today. The excuse I have is of not having a bank account which allowed me to buy it. I had to open an international account which required me to jump through several hoops and pay substantial fees to do any such transaction. While it is much simpler in 2021, I cannot blame banking system for failing me. I am saying this because a former colleague jumped through those hoops only to acquire a single stock in $TSLA, and is currently sitting at 5x gains. It is not about the gains or losses, it is about following through and go past the painful steps in a journey.

Having ranted about not having any Bitcoins, I want to give one advice though - Never sell $BTC. No matter the condition, sell everything else, but not $BTC. It is equal of land analogy. Buy land, they don't make it anymore (at least till Mars is colonized).

Best, Umang
