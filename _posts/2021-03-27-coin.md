Well 2021 is not very different than 2020. The world changed suddenly and we are yet to pick up the pieces from 2020. Although I did not post for much of 2020, it was not due to overwork fatigue. I did however realized that it is hard for me to turn off, and there is always the temptation to keep at it. 

As one grows old, one tends to accumulate regrets. They are generally linked to missed opportunities, about the doors what closed while we were day dreaming. One common one I find is for people who did no buy Bitcoin.

Best, Umang
