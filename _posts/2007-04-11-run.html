<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Part 2</span> of three part series <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2007/04/walk.html">Walk</a>, <a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2007/04/run.html">Run</a>, and <a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2007/04/fly.html">Fly</a>.<br /></span>---------------<br /><br />I love running, because of its fundamental nature. But, how often do we run? While our aspirations may be to cover a whole lot more distance, only walking isn't going to take one far.<br /><br />How does one run? What is running? Wouldn't it lead to burn out and exhaustion, pain etc.?<br />I say No. A big No. A bigger No. No No No.<br /><br />Innovation has the power to turn a simple stroll into a nimble/brisk walk, and finally to a run. Leverage and consolidate to stride ahead faster, better, stronger and smarter.<br /><br />For me, if at the end of any exercise, task, a day, week or month - if one does not evolve as a smarter being - it was pretty much a waste of time. Smartness is what will prevent exhaustion and still allow one to run/gain momentum.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Why?</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Just another question.</span><br />This is sort of a clich√©d question. Lots of people have already been here and done trying to answer this, and almost always a new version of fundamentally same thing is tossed around in different packages. Most of them are correct to their respective situations and degrees.<br /><br />What is it that drives us? What urges us to excel? Most of it is selfish ends but more importantly, in this mortal world everyone wants to leave their permanent marks on the sands of time. This is what makes us push the envelope just enough to feel our significance in this seemingly eternal cosmic trance.<br /></div><br />And, oh yes, do keep in mind the <span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">[If]</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:100%;" >--</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can keep your head when all about you </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">But make allowances for their doubting too;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can wait and not be tired of waiting,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can dream - and not make dreams your master</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can meet with triumph and disaster</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And treat those two imposters just the same;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Or watch the things you gave your life to broken</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can make one heap of all your winnings</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And lose and start again at your beginnings</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And never breathe a word about your loss;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">And so hold on when there is nothing in you</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Except the will which says to them "hold on"</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If you can talk to crowds and keep your virtue,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If all men count with you, but none too much,</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 51);">If you can fill the unforgiving minute</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 51);">With sixty seconds worth of distance <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);font-size:130%;" >run</span> -</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 51);">Yours is the Earth and every thing that is in it </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 51);">And which is more you'll be a Man my son!</span> </span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">- Rudyard Kipling</span><br /><br /><br />Contd... in <a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2007/04/fly.html">Fly</a><br />--<br />US<br /><br />Update: Publishing an extract from previous post <span style="font-size:85%;">(<a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2006/08/olop-open-discussion-group.html">oloP: Open Discussion Group</a>)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Every morning, in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">He knows he must run faster than the fastest of lions, lest he will be killed.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Every morning a lion wakes up.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">He knows he must out-run the slowest gazelle, lest he will starve to death.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">It doesn't matter whether you are a gazelle or a lion --</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">When the sun rises, you better be running.</span>
