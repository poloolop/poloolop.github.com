I attended last week's Open House at [Ather Energy](https://www.atherenergy.com/)'s new office at Dairy Circle, Bangalore. It was a gathering of over 3 dozen auto and tech enthusiasts, and Ather presented evolution of their product over the last three years.
</p>

They have gone past **V0** (Version-0) stage of the vehicle three months earlier, and are working hard towards **V1**. It will  be the version which ships to consumers. Although they were pretty tight lipped about price and timeline, it looks like they intend to ship ~10,000 scooters in 2018. There was no hint about price range or launch dates.

In terms of specifications, they didn't reveal anything other than what is available on their website. I picked up few interesting tid-bits from the presentation

1. **Fast-charging Infrastructure** - 1 hour to charge to full range. They will be deploying these across the cities in which they launch. It seems they would launch across fewer cities in the beginning and then branch out slowly.
2. **On-board charger** - The scooter will carry an on-board charger which can charge the scooter from any outlet and charge at 1 KWhour rate. 
3. **Ather App** - It's not clear all the options that will be available at launch, however they intend to have several innovative features in this companion app. 

I am not in the market looking for a two-wheeler in near future, however many friends and family keep purchasing two-wheelers. Its pretty risky to buy an unproven product from a new company. One way to win customers is by offering incredible value, and let the product speak for itself i.e. word of mouth / referrals. 

Ather has taken a very difficult challenge, to enter a crowded and mature segment in world's largest two-wheeler market. I am sure Honda, TVS, Eicher etc. are keeping a close eye on them, especially since they got massive backing from Hero Motors. 

## Feedback

I had to leave early as the event went beyond it's scheduled time. I didn't get the chance to give feedback directly. I am noting few points from my perspective. 

1. **Cut the flab, Ship** - I saw lots of work being done for the dashboard / navigation etc. All these are nice to have bells-and-whistles, however they should not in anyway shift focus from shipping a fully-functional and durable vehicle. 
2. **Value Proposition** - Mahindra, currently the only other serious Electric vehicle vendor in India, has tried to establish the value proposition of an electric vehicle. Ather should also be able to put this point across, as value conscious customers would depend on the economics of running an electric vehicle vs. Internal Combustion Engine vehicle, to justify the purchase. Ride quality and experience are also important, however, customers are always interested in their bottom line.
3. **Pricing** - Choose a high price, however have excellent financing and leasing options. I think Bajaj Finance etc, are leaders in two-wheeler financing and leasing. This makes the product accessible to a wider audience. Again, if the economics of an electric vehicle works, then it will create a virtuous cycle and sustain interest from a wide audience.
4. **Future** - Future is electric, there is no doubt about the same. The question is how quickly and how efficiently Automotive industry moves away from ICE. It depends on wide variety of innovative products such as S340. However there is no single silver bullet. Ather will need to execute on multiple fronts to reach truly meaningful volumes.

I wish them all the best towards launch of S340 and Ather experience centers. I look forward to take a test-ride of the vehicle and check their app. 

Best, Umang
