<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was recently discussing with a colleague that he has pretty thin, wiry and long fingers, and thus should have been an Artist, instead of an Engineer. He agreed. We all have our, 'If I had studied ... instead' moments.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">British Council is asking the same question on their site '<a href="http://knowledgeisgreat.in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Knowledge is Great</a>' -</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"If you could study / specialize in any subject of your choice in the UK, what would it be, where and why"?</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For me the answer is simple. Having read about Anthropology and Human Evolution by Naturalist Charles Darwin, it has to be Anthropology at Cambridge, which is also Darwin's Alma Mater.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-klzQ0LiZ9G4/UtEdawXgrCI/AAAAAAAAEUo/gRgdoYl43QA/s1600/Charles_Darwin_by_Flickr_Alan_Perestrello.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img alt="Flickr CC Some rights reserved by Alan Perestrello" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-klzQ0LiZ9G4/UtEdawXgrCI/AAAAAAAAEUo/gRgdoYl43QA/s1600/Charles_Darwin_by_Flickr_Alan_Perestrello.jpg" height="400" title="Flickr CC Some rights reserved by Alan Perestrello" width="266" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change." - Charles Darwin</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;My other inspiration to study Anthropology comes from none other than Pulitzer Prize winning author Jared Diamond. I reviewed his book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_(book)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collapse</a> <a href="http://www.umangsaini.in/2008/08/implode.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The crux of success or failure as a society is to know which core values to hold on to and which ones to discard and replace with new values when times change." - Jared Diamond in Book Collapse</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The reason for choosing Cambridge is also straight forward and needs no explanation. Their reputation in world of education is unmatched, and their standards of excellence are known by one and all.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If I were to turn back time and choose my subject again, Arts and Humanities would be my first choice, and Anthropology as specialization. But alas, there's no way of doing that now. However one can always keep learning new things anytime, anywhere. Go figure and learn.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Best, Umang</span>
