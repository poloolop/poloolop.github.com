I have had a minor obsession with gold, both as an object of desire and as an investment. It has always played a key role in marketing as well, where it's touted as the best version of some product. There are gold watches, golden phones, gold shaded decoration items etc. It's is generally reserved for something special, and recently Colgate invoked 'Gold' to persent their newest toothbrush.  #Colgate360GoldMornings

All this made for an interesting review for me, as they kindly sent me one to try.

At the onset, I have been a Colgate user since forever. It's something to do with their quality and I end up disliking all other toothpaste's I've used. For Toothbrush however, I've had no such preference. I use pretty much whatever is on the shelf in soft-bristle variety. Trying out their new 'Charcoal' laced brush was a new experience.

For me toothpaste is something that made a big difference, and I only use 'Colgate Total', which gives me a clean 12 hours of freshness. I have tried other Colgate products, but nothing comes close to Colgate Total. And now, I have to say that 360 Gold toothbrush is a worth companion to my favorite Toothbrush. I have felt shinier and cleaner teeth, for longer duration. And the brush is just exquisitely made and presented.

Thanks Colgate for sending me a review unit. Now my morning combo is set. Colgate Total + 360 Gold. 

Best, Umang
