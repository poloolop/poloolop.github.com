<div style="text-align: justify;">Just came across the story of <a href="http://www.adventnet.com/">AdventNet's</a> CEO Sridhar Vembu, on Forbes - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/02/22/mitra-zoho-india-tech-inter-cx_sm_0222mitra.html?feed=rss_popstories">The smartest unknown Indian Entrepreneur</a>.<br /><br />The article tracks AdventNet's success in Network management products and now CRM /productivity suite <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a>.<br /><br />Even though I've used Zoho, I never knew that it was made by Chennai based, 600 employee strong AdventNet and  was actually founded way back in 1996. Forbes article places its revenues at $40 million and profits at a stunning $12 million. That is roughly Rs. 8 lacs per annum of profit per employee, and this is not the sweetest part of the story.<br /><br />AdventNet's Zoho is competing with CRM behemoth <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a> and Google's Document suite. The cost differential - $10 of Zoho vs. $65 per month of Salesforce.com. All this by a privately owned Indian firm which is rewriting rules in Software as a Service (SaaS) market.<br /><br />Stunning and Bold.<br /><br />Zoho CRM, Projects, Business, Meeting, Mail, Chat, Planner, Wiki, Notebook, DB and Reports, Creator, Show, Sheet and Writer. Phew. <span style="font-weight: bold;">14 in total</span>. This is still less than their Network Management product line-up.<br /><br />I will be trying out more Zoho products. As far as their corporate motto goes "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excellence Matters</span>", its worth a try.<br /><br />Do give the Forbes article a read. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/02/22/mitra-zoho-india-tech-inter-cx_sm_0222mitra.html?feed=rss_popstories">Link again</a>. (It's much well written). It also has a link to Sramana Mitra's 7 part interview of Sridhar Vembu -<a href="http://sramanamitra.com/2007/07/10/happily-bootstrapping-zoho-ceo-sridhar-vembu-part-1/"><span style="font-size:100%;">Happily Bootstrapping: Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu</span></a><h1 style="font-weight: normal;" class="title" id="post-1205"></h1><br />--<br />US<br /><br />Update: I missed Zoho24x7, Viewer, Polls and Challenge. That makes it 18 in all.<br /></div>
