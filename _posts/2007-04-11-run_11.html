<div><span>Part 2</span> of three part series <span><a href="https://umangsaini.site/2007/04/walk/">Walk</a>, <a href="https://umangsaini.site/2007/04/run/">Run</a>, and <a href="https://umangsaini.site/2007/04/fly/">Fly</a>.<br></span>---------------<br><br>I love running, because of its fundamental nature. But, how often do we run? While our aspirations may be to cover a whole lot more distance, only walking isn't going to take one far.<br><br>How does one run? What is running? Wouldn't it lead to burn out and exhaustion, pain etc.?<br>I say No. A big No. A bigger No. No No No.<br><br>Innovation has the power to turn a simple stroll into a nimble/brisk walk, and finally to a run. Leverage and consolidate to stride ahead faster, better, stronger and smarter.<br><br>For me, if at the end of any exercise, task, a day, week or month - if one does not evolve as a smarter being - it was pretty much a waste of time. Smartness is what will prevent exhaustion and still allow one to run/gain momentum.<br><br><span>Why?</span><br><span>Just another question.</span><br>This is sort of a clich√©d question. Lots of people have already been here and done trying to answer this, and almost always a new version of fundamentally same thing is tossed around in different packages. Most of them are correct to their respective situations and degrees.<br><br>What is it that drives us? What urges us to excel? Most of it is selfish ends but more importantly, in this mortal world everyone wants to leave their permanent marks on the sands of time. This is what makes us push the envelope just enough to feel our significance in this seemingly eternal cosmic trance.<br></div><br>And, oh yes, do keep in mind the <span><span>[If]</span> <span>--</span></span><br><br><span>If you can keep your head when all about you </span><br><span>are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</span><br><span>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</span><br><span>But make allowances for their doubting too;</span><br><span>If you can wait and not be tired of waiting,</span><br><span>Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,</span><br><span>Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,</span><br><span>And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;</span><br><br><span>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master</span><br><span>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</span><br><span>If you can meet with triumph and disaster</span><br><span>And treat those two imposters just the same;</span><br><span>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken</span><br><span>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</span><br><span>Or watch the things you gave your life to broken</span><br><span>And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;</span><br><br><span>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</span><br><span>And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss</span><br><span>And lose and start again at your beginnings</span><br><span>And never breathe a word about your loss;</span><br><span>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</span><br><span>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</span><br><span>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</span><br><span>Except the will which says to them "hold on"</span><br><br><span>If you can talk to crowds and keep your virtue,</span><br><span>Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;</span><br><span>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</span><br><span>If all men count with you, but none too much,</span><br><span>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</span><br><span>With sixty seconds worth of distance <span>run</span> -</span><br><span>Yours is the Earth and every thing that is in it </span><br><span><span>And which is more you'll be a Man my son!</span> </span><br><br><span>- Rudyard Kipling</span><br><br><br>Contd... in <a href="https://umangsaini.site/2007/04/fly/">Fly</a><br>--<br>US<br><br>Update: Publishing an extract from previous post <span>(<a href="https://umangsaini.site/2006/08/olop-open-discussion-group/">oloP: Open Discussion Group</a>)</span><br><br><span>Every morning, in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.</span><br><span>He knows he must run faster than the fastest of lions, lest he will be killed.</span><br><span>Every morning a lion wakes up.</span><br><span>He knows he must out-run the slowest gazelle, lest he will starve to death.</span><br><span>It doesn't matter whether you are a gazelle or a lion --</span><br><span>When the sun rises, you better be running.</span>
