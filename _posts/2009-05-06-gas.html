<p align="justify">After 45 months on Private gas, I got my first state subsidized gas connection in April. The procedure to get a connection swivels around a document called <strong>Ration Card </strong>in Bangalore. This card is amongst the hardest to procure and upkeep in India. Passport and Voting ID card being the other two. </p>  <p align="justify">I took a longer but arguably simpler route to get the connection from  Muzaffarnagar, and transferred it to Bangalore. The transfer was quick, however it still took <strong>4 weeks and five visits</strong> to complete the process.</p>  <ol>   <li>     <div align="justify"><strong>Visit 1</strong> – No Confirmation letter. The official rule requires a confirmation letter on top of  transfer-challan. This is a  hand-written letter from the previous gas agency confirming that you have surrendered the previous one. This took a week to procure. </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify"><strong>Visit 2</strong> – Saturday – Computers not working, so no work </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify"><strong>Visit 3</strong> – Monday 9:30 AM – No connections before 10:00 AM </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify"><strong>Visit 4</strong> – Monday 4:00 PM – No connections after noon. </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify"><strong>Visit 5 </strong>– Saturday 10:30 – 4/18. Final success. Took 45 minutes to complete the formalities and pick the cylinder. </div>   </li> </ol>  <p align="justify"><strong>Cost</strong></p>  <ol>   <li>     <div align="justify">Security – <strong>Rs. 1400</strong> </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify">Cylinder 14.4 kg – <strong>Rs. 323</strong>  (Private 12kg costs ~<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rs. 480</span>, in May 2009)</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify">Regulator – <strong>Rs. 150</strong> </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify">Orange Gas Pipe (new, more secure) – <strong>Rs. ~200</strong> </div>   </li> </ol>  <p align="justify">I had a hard time finding the nearest gas agency. For the convenience of other’s I’ve marked it on my publicly listed map.
