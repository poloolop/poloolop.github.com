<div style="text-align: justify;">There's a long history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline">pipeline</a>. Pipeline's have revolutionized our living styles. Be it in any sector, but myself being in a technical field, Microprocessor pipelines are of more interest to me.<br /><br />Intel, had an addiction with the pipeline idea, when they moved from 0 to 8  stages to 14, 20 and eventually 31 in P4 Netburst, only to realize that increasing the pipeline wasn't a linear gain scenario. It was an inverse parabola, where after some steps the penalty for pipeline thrashing is more time consuming than the gain it provides by pre-fetching longer list instructions. With their latest line they are back to the sweet spot of 14.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The point?</span><br />We all have our own pipelines. The way we live, we execute our tasks in sequence. Of-course there is a scheduler, but the tasks are always arranged in a pipeline, waiting for their turn to get executed and eventually achieve completion/closure.<br /><br />One can easily arrange one's pipelines, and see their progress, pace and re-arrange tasks to achieve better throughput.<br />Here are few of my personal categories and items stuck there<br /><br />1. Career<br />    a. Current Project<br />    b. EoP<br /><br />2. Blog<br />    a. Pipe-line (current task)<br />    b. Walk (0%)<br />    c. Run (60%)<br />    d. Fly (60%)<br />    e. Foot-print (30%)<br />    f. Audit (30%)<br />    g. Organ-ize (10%)<br />    h. Intelli-conv (40%)<br /><br />3. Personal<br />    a. Passport<br />    b. Hair cut<br />    c. A Photo Story Movie Project (5%)<br /> d. Audit<br /> e. Weight gain<br /><br />...<br />...<br /><br />This structure provides one a tremendous sense of clarity and direction.<br /><br />P.S - This post was supposed to be a pre-cursor of what is in store. I am slow in scheduling this pipeline as of now. But as we all know, if it grows to long, Pipeline thrashing can become very expensive.<br /><br />--<br />US<br /></div>
