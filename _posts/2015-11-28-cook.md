I have been taking pictures of my food since I can remember taking pics. Its something a lot of people find frivolous. What's the use? Well it's an archive. A documentation process. A way to keep track of where the calories are coming from.

Few months back, [@GooglePhotos](https://twitter.com/googlephotos), added a ton of advanced features to their product. Firstly the made the storage unlimited! I promptly started uploading my 25GB of photos ~18000 photos taken over last 11 years. What the product did was stunning. Auto-categorization of pictures by people, places and things is amazing. It's a life saver. One never has to organize any pictures. The organization is really neat and saves ton of time. After Search, Android, Chrome and YouTube, Photos is clearly now the defining product from Google. You have to try it, what's to lose? (Their photos backup tools are painless and do the job)

Well this post is not about Google Photos. Its about cooking. We had a distributed potluck in my team at work. All nine members to bring a dish at a different day, which will add variety to daily routine lunch. Six out of nine ended up bringing dessert. That's the charm of sweets in India. Every region brought it's own unique element to the table. Here's a sample of my food pics, taken straight from Google Photos.

Typically I rarely cook food. However for this potluck, it was mandatory for the participant to prepare the dish himself or herself. I prepared stir-fried Capsicum-Mushroom dish with Vinegar and Soya sauce. I am not going to share that recipe. But [Sugar-Free](http://sugarfree-india.com/) asked to share recipe of some sweet dish, so here you go -

**Ingredients**

1. 1 kg of carrots, finely grated
2. 4 cups almond milk OR full-fat milk
3. 6 cardamom pods
4. 1 tbsp vegetable oil
5. 4-6 tbsp equivalent of sugar-free
6. A handful of cashews, raisins and walnuts!

**Method**

1. Clean the carrots and grate them finely. This is time consuming work. Have patience. 
2. Place the carrots, cardamom and milk into a thick-bottom pan. Cook this on medium heat. The milk will boil and needs occassional stirring. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated. This will take about 35 to 45 minutes.
3. In another pan, heat the vegetable oil, add the carrots mixture to it and fry. Keep stirring till the carrots turn to rich red color. This will take additional 10-12 minutes. 
4. Now simply add the sugar-free and stir until it's well mixed. Add cashews and raisins, and stir cook for two more minutes.
5. Done. Garnish with chopped walnuts. It can be eaten warm or at room temperature. 

I don't have a picture of this when I made this recipe, however there's a pic of the same dish prepare by my team member for potluck -
