<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, author of '<a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/permission/">Permission Marketing</a>', cites the importance of permission as an important asset for any business. Sadly, permission is typically <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">assumed</span>, <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">abused</span> or <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">overused</span>. Take telecommunication operators for example. Until recently my operator started sending a barrage of marketing messages to me <span style="font-size:85%;">(more than three a day)</span>. I promptly registered for the 'Do Not Call' facility, only to receive following text -<br /><blockquote><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Dear Customer, Your request (No. 10003077047) for Do Not Call facility is registered. It will be active within 45 days. Reliance</span><br /></blockquote>And they've followed their promise, they are still sending messages to me, 35 days into the registration.<br /><br />There's the other end of the spectrum, where entities like <a href="http://www.mginger.com/">mGinger</a> and <a href="http://www.youmint.com/">YouMint</a> will pay you to receive targeted advertisements. They put a price for your attention and time. The problem is that in a <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">me-me-me</span> centric world, I am not interested in telling you what I want.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br /><br />--<br />US<br /><br /></div>
