Indian telecom sector is an odd market. It's an extremely complex sector and mission critical for India to succeed in improving incomes of millions of Indians from a paltry $1600 (real, $6000 in PPP terms, year 2016). Even though there are more than 1 billion telecom subscribers, only 220mn use wireless broadband (3G/4G LTE). 

Indian telecom industry has succeeded on several fronts, but it has been slow in following two areas
1. Mobile Payments
2. Mobile Broadband

Both of these represent incredible opportunities, however it is not clear how to make majority subscribers to convert to always-on-data. With such low income levels, very few are able to afford and maintain smartphones. Majority still prefer feature phones, and voice is their primary usage.
