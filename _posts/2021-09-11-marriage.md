10 years of Marriage. 10 takeaways.

I cannot say that now I am an expert in marital relationships, but I will try and list the things that have helped me cross the 10 year mark.

I got married on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Here are the 10 key things which I found are important 

1. Equality - Anthropologist Helen FIsher in her TED talk in 2006 - Link - https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_why_we_love_why_we_cheat - 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage," or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage." This is a marriage between equals,.
2. Choice - If you have doubts about the choices and judgement of your partner, always remember that "you" were also their choice. i.e. They chose you and discounting your partners discretionary choices is undermining yourself
3. Ek Chidiya jiske sir par per - Rough translation - A bird which has a head, wings and legs.
4. New set of parents - You get a new set of parents after marriage. They are in every way equal to your own birth parents. The amount of love, affection and respect you show to your new parents should not be any different. This takes some time to get used to, but the sooner you realize the equivalence, the better. Since it will help simplify a lot of decisions that you make.
5. Health - Your partner's health is your responsibility as well, and vice versa. Indian marriage rituals codify this into the wedding vows itself. If one is able to follow a good chunk of their wedding vows, then relationships are expected to benefit from the distilled wisdom of accumulated and refined over several generations.
6. Happiness - Every individual in a  relationship needs to work on its
7. Finance - Any income should be divided equally between the partners. There is one school of thought which says to keep your finances separate, but I believe in splitting household income 50-50 between the partners. This should reflect in the assets either be in joint accounts, or investments are made in the name of both partners after marriage. There should also be complete transparency in the net assets and investments between the partners. It is a matter of trust, and there is no reason that all income of a family is being invested in a single partners name. There is no reason to keep the account statements 
8. Budget - Have a monthly / quarterly / annual budget. Stick to it. Purchase decisions for all items above a certain price point is made jointly. This may make the decisions slower, but neither partner should have unilateral authority on spending from the budget. Spending should be kept within the budget.
9. Investment - For larger purchase decisions like land, apartment, four wheeler, do make sure to loop in both set of parents into the decision. Even if the final decision is yours, it is very important to take parents inputs on larger monetary decisions. 
10. Communicate - Keep it simple and unfiltered. Any expectations which are not said out loud are

This list is far from comprehensive, and I am sure I have missed several much more important points. And no list can ever be above fundamental romantic love in a marriage.


Best,
Umang
