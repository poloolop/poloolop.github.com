<div style="text-align: center;">GNU Linux is for servers, Windows is for desktop.<br /></div><br />That is my basis of engagement with operating systems (OSX Macs being too expensive and closed). However this equation is changing slowly but surely, as some modern operating systems are crumbling under their own weight (read Vista).<br /><br />Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) was released recently (22nd April), and it makes installation process of GNU Linux  significantly easier. I've tried Fedora, Suse and RHEL in the past, and Ubuntu definitely lives up to it's promise of "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux for human beings</span>". My target was to compile a kernel from kernel.org and test a loadable driver module with it. Here's my step by step experience with 9.04 -<br /><br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Download</span> - 700MB from ubuntu.com/download. I too desktop version</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Burn the ISO</span> (you may use virtual CD programs to load the ISO directly)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-run on Windows</span> gives three options. The safest one is - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wubi</span> - Windows-based Ubuntu Installer. It will install Ubuntu as a regular program, which you may uninstall anytime. Zero pain and wicked fast. The other way is to either create a Live-CD/USB or install it on a clean partition. In the third case, uninstallation may be painful. I chose Wubi with 6GB size. Although I recommend 8GB if you want to compile your own kernel etc. (it will take 1GB+ for this alone)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation</span> - It would take 15-20 minutes.<br /></li></ol>Following are the things I did after installation -<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup WiFi</span> - The Network Mgmt Applet on desktop panel is simple.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch Update Manager</span> (System -> Administration ->). If one skips this it will launch on it's own for updating some packages.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play Music</span> - This will again prompt for MP3 packages, which Synaptics (package management) will take care. (No need to hunt for any package)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox plugins</span> - The default browser is Mozilla Firefox. I installed few plugins such as Xmarks and Google Toolbar</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Install Adobe Flash and Air</span> - Almost any website one opens runs into some flash component. Installation is a breeze. It will download a <span style="font-weight: bold;">*.bin</span> file or  <span style="font-weight: bold;">*.deb <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>package. Double click to install. Each installation requires authorization of primary account.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Picasa 3</span> - Photo management software from Google</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Office</span> is pre-installed, however only three spreadsheet, presentation and writer is present. For others you can use Add/Remove option. I installed Python IDE and removed a bunch of games.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enable 4 desktops</span> - It has two desktops by default. You may right click on Workspace Switching area and change preferences.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skype</span> - Installed Skype</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MPlayer</span> - Installed Mplayer from Synaptics Package Manger (Syste -> Administration ->). For me it works only with -vo gl2, otherwise failing to play video.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opera</span> - I installed Opera 9.6. also. It's a touch faster than Firefox to launch. Otherwise browsing experience is mostly similar.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gnome Panel</span> adjustment - While adjusting the top panel, I accidently deleted it. To get it back you may use following commands in a terminal -<br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 0, 0);">    gconftool-2 --shutdown</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"><br />    rm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/panel</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"><br />    pkill gnome-panel</span></li></ol>That's it. All of the above took about 90 minutes. I was ready for the next stage.<br /><br />Installing new Kernel<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Root user</span> (sudo passwd root) or use (sudo -i) for root terminal.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Install</span> linux-source-* package from Package manager</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unzip-tar</span> the package in /usr/src (bzip2 -d *.bz2, tar -xvf *.tar)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make xconfig</span> (for this you will have to install qt3-devel and g++ available in package manager). You may add/remove kernel modules, options.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make </span>-j2 bzImage<br />make modules<br />make modules_install<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">update-inramfs</span> -c 2.6.x-y (your version of kernel from /lib/modules/*</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update /boot</span> -<br />Copy /usr/src/linus-source-2.6.x-y/arch/x86/boot/<span style="font-weight: bold;">bzImage</span> to /boot/bzImage-2.6.x-y<br />Copy /usr/src/linus-source-2.6.x-y/<span style="font-weight: bold;">System.map</span> to /boot/System.map-2.6.x-y.<br />Rename <span style="font-weight: bold;">initrd.img</span> created by step 5 to a common naming scheme, namely initrd.img-2.6.x-y</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grub Entry </span>- Make the entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst - Just make a similar entry as the primary option. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reboot</span> - While booting Ubuntu, press Esc key and choose the new option. Viola you are using your new kernel having modules in /lib/modules/2.6.x-y<br /></li></ol>Compiling the kernel will take significant time, depending on how fast your computer is. It tooke my Centrino single core x86 machine ~45 minutes.<br /><br />Few review points -<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pro's</span><br /><ol><li>Free</li><li>Things work (sometimes, else Google). Slick package management and update experience.<br /></li><li>Wubi - Makes it remarkably easy. It's makes it yet another Application</li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cons</span><br /><ol><li>Built-in fonts are not very appealing</li><li>Some DRM / closed devices won't work. iPhone / iPod Touch for example.</li><li>Misses variety of killer apps</li><li>Things don't work (few things) - The clock fails for me, mp4 video works in gl2 mode only, sometimes Wireless card is not detected (reboot solves it). These are however minor and rare issues. (you may have your own :-))<br /></li></ol>I'll stick to my original engagement with OS's, however Ubuntu 9.04 breaks several barriers. If you've never used Linux or had abandoned it in the past, do take it for a spin. It won't take much time and may just change your notion of your primary desktop OS.<br /><br />--<br />US<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Still unsure </span>- You may want to read these two articles<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217200717&amp;subSection=News"> Inside Ubuntu 9.04</a> and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/164205/why_people_quit_linux.html">Seven reasons why people quit Linux</a> to make up your mind.<br /><br />p.s. - This is my first blog post written running Ubuntu.
