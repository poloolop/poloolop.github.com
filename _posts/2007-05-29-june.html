<div align="justify">This post is about <a href="http://www.zune.net/">Zune</a>.<br /><br />A lot of my friends are convinced on buying Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">iPod Video</a> 5.5G 30GB, and some have already made the <a href="http://staneymv.blogspot.com/">mistake</a>. For others, here's my opinion on Handheld Portable Media Players<br /><br />1. They are expensive.<br />2. They are not much useful.<br />3. Wearing earphones is not much fun/comfortable for long periods.<br /><br />Even after considering the above points, you still want one, go ahead BUT try to avoid the Apple iPod Video (just my opinion!). Here are my reasons<br /></div><ol><li><div align="justify">$200 for a Black Zune <span style="font-size:85%;">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/zune/">link</a>) vs. $250 for iPod video.<br /></span></div></li><li><div align="justify">3.0" in Zune vs. 2.5" of iPod video. Bigger is better.</div></li><li><div align="justify">Toshiba's Gigabeat technology</div></li><li><div align="justify">Reverse syncing of non-DRM songs</div></li><li><div align="justify">Rubberized body so no need for a cover or worry about scratches</div></li><li><div align="justify">WiFi for sharing songs and maybe more options as firmware is revised</div></li><li><div align="justify">FM Tuner!!</div></li><li><div align="justify">Supposedly Zune's got better battery life (only a speculation)</div></li><li><div align="justify">iPod Video 30GB's BOM (Bill of Materials) is only $151, a cool $98 for Apple. <span style="font-size:85%;">(<a href="http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172303152">link</a>)</span></div></li></ol><p align="justify">Although there are few plus points for iPod Video -</p><ol><li><div align="justify">Click Wheel</div></li><li><div align="justify">Better looks</div></li></ol><p align="justify">I do not consider the above two differences reason enough to tank $50 extra on iPod video vs. Zune. </p><p align="justify">My verdict is to avoid the purchase, but if you must, Zune makes much more sense.</p><p align="justify">--</p><p align="justify">US</p><p align="justify">P.S - In case you do not agree, leave your arguments in the comments. I will try to reply to them. And no other $100 cheapo MPEG4 players do not make any sense either. For those considering <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a>, do look at <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Catalog%281166%29-SanDisk_Sansa_e200_Series_MP3_Players.aspx">Sansa e200</a> series <span style="font-size:85%;">(cheaper, with FM, voice recorder, MJPEG video playback, but it is not so slick/stylisy and does not sport the surreal click-wheel)</span></p>
