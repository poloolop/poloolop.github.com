With the emotional [announcement](https://twitter.com/Micromax__India/status/1316998886918029312) of returning to the smartphone game, Micromax is responding to the 4-6% support which GOI promised to device manufacturers in India. Early reports suggest that the devices are in the range of ₹7k to ₹25k will be using [MediaTek Helio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_processors) chipsets. They intend to sell other smart devices as well (ACs, TV?)

Here is my unsolicited advice to Micromax.

## Updates / Support
In the past you have rarely followed the 18-month OS / 24-months security update policy. Now that Samsung and Google pledge to 36-months OS updates, the stakes are higher. Spreading your product line thin and not keeping the devices up to date is leaving your customers high and dry. 

I don't mind if you charge users for OS updates, and only do it makes financial sense in rolling out the same.

## Exchange
The way to win the market share is to grow number of active devices, and ensure these customers buy the next device again from you. For this you need to offer longer/cheaper support and higher discounts for exchanging old Micromax phone for a new Micromax phone. Even at launch, if someone exchanges even a non-functional Micromax device, they should be given higher loyalty discount (it would also help you meet your device recycling numbers).

## Accessories
The way to make profits is to sell premium accessories. Make/Enable great cases, quality cables, chargers, wired earphones (co-branded are good as well)

## Catalogue / Calendar
There may be a good margin to earn in labelling other consumer durables under your brand. I would say that it dilutes the brand more than anything. Look at examples of Havells, erstwhile Videocon, Urban Ladder etc. who have gone for volume in their catalogue than quality per se. 

You don't want to release devices every 4 months, rendering the previous model obsolete. In an ideal scenario older model at a lower purchase price should be competitive for 12-18 months window. 

## Sourcing
A majority of components going into the products will be sourced directly from Chinese vendors. You want to develop alternate vendors for these in the longer run. The key is not low cost, but best quality at scale. While it is tempting to source
