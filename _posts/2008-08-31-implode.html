<div style="text-align: justify;">I completed reading Jared Diamond's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_%28book%29">Collapse</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Fail-Succeed/dp/0670033375">How societies chose to fail or succeed</a> last year.

Technological solutions to environmental problems are routinely far more expensive than preventative measures.</span></span><span><span> Essentially - Advances in technology just increases our ability to do things, which may be either for the better or for the worse. Most problems are unintended negative consequences of existent technologies. The rapid advances in technology in the 20th century has been creating more difficult new problems than it is solving old problems.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span></li><li><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"><span>If we exhaust one resource, we will use some other</span></span><br /><br /></li><li><span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">There is no food shortage</span>, we can sustain more than twice the current population.</span></span><br /><br /></li><li><span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Common sense</span> - increased life span, health, wealth. Grass is green, plenty of food, clean water from taps, no signs of collapse. A societies steep decline begins a decade or two after it reaches peak numbers - wealth and power.

Hence the best predictors of modern state failures - <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">revolutions, violent regime change, collapse of authority and genocide</span> - prove to be measures of environmental and population pressures.
