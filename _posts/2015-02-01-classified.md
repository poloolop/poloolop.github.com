## Classified

There's been a recent proliferation in online classified sites, and their value proposition is super strong. You want to buy/sell any item/service, you make a post on these sites, and within minutes you get several quotes from interested individuals or vendors. 

So what's the catch? There are several. The market doesn't really have a clear winner, as is the case in other countries, and thus to get sufficnet number of interested parties to look at your posting, you may have to cross post on multiple classified sites. This makes it tedious to track your postings and the responses you get. There are other logistic problems as well, and number one is the way in which you get responses from interested  parties. Following are the ways they may contact you

1. **Email** - Almost never happens
2. **Phone Call** / Text /What's App - This is the medium you are most likely to be contacted about your posting. 

At first all the attention you get on your posting seems cool and desirable, but pretty soon it turns into a nuisance. Because the person on the other side can ping you anytime on your phone, interrupting continuously till it starts to get onto your nerves. This is frankly what keeps me from posting on such sites. You don't get any response if you don't leave your phone number.

Thankfully one of the sites has come up with a novel way of keeping your sanity and still be able to get decent response on your classified posting. That site is [Quickr](http://www.quikr.com/). And they are promoting the solution heavily across marketing channels. I took their solution for a spin and posted an ad for buying used bicycle accessory.

Their solution is to have private chat about the posting on their mobile app or website. Following are three reasons how this method is significantly better than revealing mobile number

1. **Avoid Calls** - You can choose Quickr chat as the first method of contact, and your mobile number remains hidden till you approve of the other person to be able to see the same. So they remove the biggest stumbling block of having to receive mindless number of calls at any random point of time.

2. **Avoid Spam** - If your phone number is not revealed on the site, you will not get spammed by unknown marketing channels. No more unknown texts, what's app messages etc.

3. **Tracking / History** - Since you have a written record of interaction with each buyer, you can hold them to their word. No longer you have to note every detail about every posting and manage the record for reference. The chat log does this automatically for you.

I am alwyas interested in buying and selling used goods, which helps one to keep only relevant stuff with you. You are no longer stuck with old stuff, and you can even buy used stuff if you want to save a bit. Chat-first is a good evolution for online classified sites, and I applaud Quickr taking the lead on this and protecting the privacy of their users.

Best, Umang
