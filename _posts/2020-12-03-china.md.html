China has achieved stunning prosperity in the last three decades. It was made possible by copying strategies which helped develop the western world. The journey ahead is going to be tougher, however they have demonstrated a strong desire to continue their march.

India on the other hand treaded more cautiously, never committing to painful reforms and the investment and accountability required to follow through on the same. There are few sectors which are able to competitive globally, however it has not resulted in the kind of economic miracle which took place in countries like South Korea, China etc.

There is also decline in competitiveness in few sectors to more focused players. There are many examples like readymade clothing by Bangladesh and cashew processing to Vietnam.
