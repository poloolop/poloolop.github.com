<div style="text-align: justify;">All right, no explanation of the title again. <a href="http://poloolop.blogspot.com/2006/10/conquistador.html">Read up</a>.<br /><br />Last time I covered <a href="http://number27.org/">Jonathan Harris</a> was way back in October 2006, and had never checked back again, until now. I had already covered <a href="http://tenbyten.org/">TenByTen</a>, <a href="http://wordcount.org/">Word Count</a>, <a href="http://timecapsule.yahoo.com/">Time Capsule</a> and a bit of <a href="http://www.phylotaxis.com/">Phylotaxis</a>.<br /><br />If you've been reading up this blog lately, you would have noticed the increased postings about talks delivered at <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a>. Yes, that's right. They recently posted one given by Jonathan Harris at TED 2007. See the connection.<br /><br />He talks about the rationale behind his body of work and shows three of his newer works. Time Capsule which I covered earlier, <a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/">We feel fine</a> and <a href="http://universe.daylife.com/">Universe</a> are the other two.<br /><br />Right now I am too tired to elaborate further, only to the extent that his new works are simply stunning. Do watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/144">here</a>. <span style="font-size:85%;">(Direct download <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/download/video/153/talk/65">zipped .mp4</a> 52MB)</span><br /><br />While you are checking the talk, do also look at some of other works listed at <a href="http://number27.org/">his site</a>. For example - <a href="http://number27.org/work/maps/index.html">Information Maps</a>, <a href="http://www.justcurio.us/">Justcurio.us</a>.<br /><br /><br />--<br />US</div>
