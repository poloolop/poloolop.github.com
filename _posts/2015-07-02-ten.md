<p>
A decade is a good chunk of time. A typical indian male will see ~6 of them (average life expectancy 64.6 years). Some chunk time in five year slots, but from a high-level viewpoint, analyzing time in decades makes sense.
I have already completed 3 decades, and first two were completely dedicated to formal-education system. The third one going completely to career.

This post is about what went well and what could've been better.

Best, Umang
