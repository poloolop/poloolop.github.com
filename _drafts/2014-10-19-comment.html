<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The festival of lights is around the corner, and many of my friends and colleagues have traveled back to their home towns to celebrate it with their families. A Diwali at home&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gharwalidiwali.com/" target="_blank">#GharWaliDiwali</a></span>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.gharwalidiwali.com/">https://www.gharwalidiwali.com</a>)<br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here's a clip of celebrating Diwali with Family &nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ7lMDWJOXA">PepsiCo #GharWaliDiwali film</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/sQ7lMDWJOXA/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/sQ7lMDWJOXA&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/sQ7lMDWJOXA&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am not traveling back to my hometown this year, but here are my top 4 ways to celebrate Diwali this year</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Support your favorite not for profit organization</b>&nbsp;- It goes a long way in supporting organizations which are working to improve our world.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip the Crackers, choose Lights</b>&nbsp;- I stopped burning crackers ~15 years back and prefer to celebrate the festival of lights, with lights. This year the critical price of LED bulbs has also gone significantly low. A 10Watts (70watt equivalent) LED bulb promising 15000 hours of light (more than twice of a conventional CFL) is now ~$9 = Rs. 550.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So from this year onwards, I've decided to replace fused CFLs with LEDs. Let's see how it goes in terms of overall savings. I will post about the experience soon. There are many ways in which LED lights are miles ahead of other forms. In comparison to CFLs they take significantly less energy, have lower to none toxic materials (like mercury) and last significantly longer than CFLs. In the wake of recent price cuts, and strong advertising by multitude of LED lighting companies, it's time to turn over the tide and shift to LED's in an affordable manner. Lighting may be less than 20% of our house's electric load, however cutting it in half will have a meaningful impact on our energy footprint. It also goes on to reduce toxic elements from our environment. It's become a no-brainer to replace fused CFL's with LED's. And Diwali is just the right and auspicious season to start this journey.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Avoid Gambling with Money and Never Drive after Drinking&nbsp;</b>- These are some of the things wrongly associated with this season of celebrations, and it shouldn't be.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wish Family, Friends and Colleagues</b><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;- Of course, it goes without saying to wish your near and dear ones a Happy Diwali. It's customary to give small tokens of gifts during this season, and I recommend giving sustainable gifts from local ArtiCraft makers.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We should strive in making Diwali a sustainable festival, where society and communities set examples of upholding to our duties towards our surroundings. This means lower noise pollution, upholding local laws, and celebrating with responsibility.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It also means not spraying&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umangsaini.in/2014/05/garbage.html" target="_blank">garbage</a>&nbsp;all around the city. This festival brings loved one's together to reflect on the blessings in our lives and strive to do better in the future.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And lastly, Have a safe and prosperous Diwali this year. May the festival of lights bring you joy and prosperity going forward and you have a wonderful time with your families.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Best,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Umang</span>
